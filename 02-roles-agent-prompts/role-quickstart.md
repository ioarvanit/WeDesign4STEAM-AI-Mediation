# Role-Based AI Mediation – How to Use

The “agents” described in this folder are not autonomous systems.
They are role descriptions and behavioral constraints that may be
used with conversational AI tools.

They are provided as:
- illustrative operational exemplars,
- not as validated instructional scripts,
- and not as required components.

Educators may adapt, simplify, or ignore these roles depending on
context, age group, and tool availability.
