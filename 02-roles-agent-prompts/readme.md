## Role-Based AI Mediation (Illustrative)

This folder provides **illustrative role descriptions** for AI mediation in the
AI-enhanced WeDesign4STEAM methodology, as described in the paper
“Repositioning Design Thinking through AI Mediation in Primary Education”.

### What these roles are
The “agents” presented here are **not autonomous systems** and do not require
special software or orchestration.

They are:
- role descriptions,
- behavioral constraints,
- and interaction guidelines

that can be enacted using standard conversational AI tools (e.g. ChatGPT),
by pasting or embedding role instructions at the beginning of an interaction.

### What these roles are not
These materials are:
- not validated instructional scripts,
- not empirically tested prompts,
- not required components of the methodology.

They are provided as **operational exemplars** to clarify how AI mediation can be
structured without a dedicated application.

### Why role-based mediation
Role-based constraints help ensure that:
- AI behavior remains aligned with Design Thinking intent,
- student agency and authorship are preserved,
- AI does not drift into evaluative or directive roles,
- interactions remain developmentally appropriate.

Educators and researchers may adapt, simplify, or omit these roles depending on:
- age group,
- context (formal or informal),
- technological setup,
- and facilitation style.

Example prompt snippets included in the role files are **illustrative only** and
serve to demonstrate tone, scope, and boundaries rather than to prescribe usage.
