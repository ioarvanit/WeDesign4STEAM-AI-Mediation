# AI Mediation in WeDesign4STEAM – At a Glance

This repository provides supplementary materials supporting the paper
“Repositioning Design Thinking through AI Mediation in Primary Education”.

The AI-enhanced WeDesign4STEAM approach repositions artificial intelligence as a
bounded pedagogical mediator within an existing card-based participatory Design
Thinking game.

AI is not treated as:
- an instructional authority,
- a solution generator,
- or an automated evaluator.

Instead, AI functions as a dialogic scaffold that supports:
- articulation of ideas,
- perspective-taking,
- reflective refinement,
- and convergence under time constraints,

while preserving student agency, facilitator mediation, and hybrid physical–digital
interaction.

All materials provided here are illustrative and conceptual. They are intended to
support replication, adaptation, and future empirical investigation, rather than to
prescribe fixed implementations.
