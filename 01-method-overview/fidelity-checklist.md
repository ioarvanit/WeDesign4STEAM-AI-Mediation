# Methodological Fidelity Checklist

An implementation may be considered consistent with
AI-mediated WeDesign4STEAM if:

☐ The physical card-based game anchors activity  
☐ Students retain authorship and decision-making authority  
☐ Facilitators do not delegate evaluative judgment to AI  
☐ AI outputs are treated as discussion resources, not answers  
☐ Multimodal student expression is supported  
☐ AI behavior is constrained by stage-specific intent  

Tool choice and level of integration may vary as long as these conditions hold.
