### Method Overview: AI-Mediated WeDesign4STEAM

This folder provides a concise conceptual overview of the **AI-mediated repositioning of the WeDesign4STEAM Design Thinking approach**, as described in the paper:

**“Repositioning Design Thinking through AI Mediation in Primary Education.”**

The materials in this folder clarify _what AI mediation means methodologically_ before any operational details (roles, prompts, workflows) are introduced.

#### Purpose of this folder

The files in this section:

-   define the **pedagogical role of AI** in the repositioned methodology,
    
-   articulate **non-negotiable methodological commitments**,
    
-   map **AI support to Design Thinking stages** without prescribing tools or implementations.
    

They are intended to be read **before** the operational materials in later folders.

### Contents

#### `ai-mediation-at-a-glance.md`

Provides a high-level framing of AI mediation in WeDesign4STEAM:

-   what AI _is_ and _is not_ within the methodology,
    
-   how AI functions as a **bounded pedagogical mediator**,
    
-   how student agency, facilitator mediation, and hybrid physical–digital interaction are preserved.
    

This file mirrors the conceptual positioning developed in **Section 4** of the paper.

----------

#### `fidelity-checklist.md`

Offers a **methodological fidelity checklist** that defines when an implementation can reasonably be considered consistent with AI-mediated WeDesign4STEAM.

The checklist emphasizes:

-   student authorship,
    
-   facilitator non-interference in decisions,
    
-   AI as a dialogic resource rather than an authority.
    

Tool choice, platform, or level of technical integration may vary, provided these conditions hold.

----------

#### `stages-map.md`

Summarizes how **AI mediation aligns with each Design Thinking stage**:

-   clarifying and condensing early-stage articulation,
    
-   supporting ideational flow during ideation,
    
-   enabling reflective convergence and optional prototyping.
    

The map highlights the **stage-sensitive nature of AI support**, a core principle of the repositioned methodology.
