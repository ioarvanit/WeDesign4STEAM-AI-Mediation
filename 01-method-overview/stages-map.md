# Design Stages and AI Mediation

The repositioned WeDesign4STEAM process retains its original stages and introduces
a reflective prototyping extension.

AI mediation is stage-sensitive:

- Stage 1 – Alter Egos: supports articulation and perspective-taking
- Stage 2 – Needs / Problems / Opportunities: supports clarification and condensation
- Stage 3 – Idea Generation: supports variation and ideational flow
- Stage 4 – Sustainability Reflection: supports concrete “what if” reasoning
- Stage 5 – Evaluation & Selection: supports comparison and neutral summarisation
- Stage 6 – Reflective Prototyping (optional): supports rapid externalisation

Across all stages, AI outputs remain optional, negotiable, and subject to human
judgment.
