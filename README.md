# WeDesign4STEAM-AI-Mediation
This repository provides **illustrative and conceptual supplementary materials** accompanying the paper:
> _Repositioning Design Thinking through AI Mediation in Primary Education_

The materials presented here exemplify how **artificial intelligence can function as a bounded pedagogical mediator** within the existing **WeDesign4STEAM** card-based participatory Design Thinking approach, without replacing its core principles of student agency, facilitator non-interference, and embodied, tool-supported collaboration.

These resources include:
-   role-based **AI interaction templates** (e.g. _Student Design Buddy_, _Facilitator Coach_),
-   **stage-specific prompt exemplars** aligned with the WeDesign4STEAM design process,
-   guidance for **tool-agnostic implementation** using standard conversational AI interfaces (e.g. ChatGPT-like systems).    

⚠️ **Important note**  
The materials in this repository are **not empirically validated classroom tools**.  They are provided as **operational exemplars** intended to:
-   support transparency and reproducibility of the proposed methodology,
-   enable exploration and adaptation by researchers and educators,
-   serve as a foundation for **future empirical studies**.

This repository complements, but does not replace, the original WeDesign4STEAM materials available at:
