# Stage-Specific AI Mediation Prompts

This folder contains **illustrative, stage-specific AI instruction prompts** supporting the AI-mediated repositioning of the WeDesign4STEAM methodology described in the paper:

**“Repositioning Design Thinking through AI Mediation in Primary Education.”**

These materials operationalize how artificial intelligence may function as a **bounded pedagogical mediator** during different stages of a participatory Design Thinking process for primary education.

---

## Purpose of this folder

The files in this folder are designed to:

- make the proposed methodology **operationally transparent**,
- demonstrate how AI behavior can be **constrained by pedagogical intent**,
- support **replication, adaptation, and future empirical testing**,
- without requiring a dedicated app or fixed technological infrastructure.

They illustrate *how AI can be instructed*, not *what students should say or do*.

---

## Important methodological clarifications

- The “prompts” provided here are **not student-facing content**.
- They are **instruction blocks** intended to be given to a conversational AI system (e.g., an LLM) to define:
  - the AI’s role,
  - its behavioral boundaries,
  - and its stage-specific pedagogical function.

- These prompts are:
  - **illustrative**, not validated scripts,
  - **conceptual**, not empirically tested,
  - **adaptable** to different ages, contexts, and tools.

Educators and researchers may:
- simplify them,
- modify them,
- embed them in apps,
- or ignore them entirely,
as long as methodological fidelity is preserved (see `01-method-overview/`).

## Folder contents

Each file corresponds to **one Design Thinking stage** and describes:

- pedagogical intent of the stage,
- the role AI may play,
- an example **AI instruction prompt** (role + constraints),
- acceptable and unacceptable AI behaviors.

Current stages included:

- `stage-1-alter-egos.md`  
  *Perspective-taking and identity externalisation*

- `stage-2-needs-problems-opportunities.md`  
  *Clarification, articulation, and condensation of student input*

- `stage-3-ideation.md`  
  *Generative stimulation without solution takeover*

- `stage-4-sustainability.md`  
  *Concrete sustainability-oriented reflection*

- `stage-5-evaluation-selection.md`  
  *Comparison and convergence without delegating judgment*

- `stage-6-reflective-prototyping.md`  
  *Lightweight externalisation and iterative reflection*

## How these prompts may be used in practice

The prompts may be enacted through:

- standard conversational AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT-like systems),
- copy–paste role instructions at the start of a session,
- facilitator-managed AI interactions,
- or simple custom applications that automate prompt delivery
  (e.g., via buttons, stages, or QR-linked cards).

They are **tool-agnostic by design**.

---

## What these prompts are NOT

These materials do **not**:

- prescribe exact classroom scripts,
- define learning outcomes,
- replace facilitation,
- or turn AI into a decision-maker or evaluator.

All AI outputs remain:
- optional,
- negotiable,
- and subject to human judgment.

## Relation to the paper

In the paper, these materials are referenced as **online supplementary exemplars**
supporting the methodological repositioning of WeDesign4STEAM.

They serve as a bridge between:
- conceptual design principles, and
- future design-based research or classroom experimentation.

*AI mediation adapts to the design process —  
the design process does not adapt to AI.*
