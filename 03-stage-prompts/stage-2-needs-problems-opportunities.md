# Stage 2 – Needs, Problems, Opportunities

AI mediation at this stage may support:
- clarification of context prompts,
- articulation of student responses,
- condensation into clear statements.

Typical AI behaviors:
- Rephrase student input into one clear sentence
- Ask one clarification question
- Offer up to two alternative formulations

AI should not:
- propose solutions,
- evaluate importance,
- merge ideas without human confirmation.
